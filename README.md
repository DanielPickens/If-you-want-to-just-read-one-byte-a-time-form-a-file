# If-you-want-to-just-read-one-byte-a-time-form-a-file
That 1 bit at time way of life , for files

For clarification: 
My code here is being readily used to get content from a file and read the content 1 byte at a time. Using the ReadByte() function, we are reading a byte from the file and this allows and advances the read position one byte.

A added " While" loop is used to check the line is not equal to -1. If the condition is true then  it will go ahead and execute the iteration of the loop. Here it firsts gets the contents from a file and reads the content per byte and  then will print the value.
